## Installation

I would suggest installing it from the vscode marketplace, but if you'd like to manually install it, please follow the below steps

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gabrielhutu/perplexity-ext 
$ cd ./perplexity-ext
$ npm install 
$ npx @vscode/vsce packge
```

After the above is completed, a vsix file should be generated in the root directory of this repository. 
Please install the vsix file by following the steps outlined [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).
